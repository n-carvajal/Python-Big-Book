## Project 02: The Matching Birthday Paradox

The Birthday Paradox is the surprisingly high probability that two or more
people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people.

In a group of 70 people there is a 99.99% percent chance that at least two
people having matching birthdays.
Surprisingly, even in a group as small as 23 people there is a 50% chance of
one or more matching birthdays.

This program performs several probability experiments to determine the
percentages for groups of different sizes. It does so by generating multiple
random groups of birthdates and then looking for matching dates within each
group.

Execute `main.py` to run the program which upon start-up will prompt the user
for a sample birthdate size and subsequently the number of simulations to run.
