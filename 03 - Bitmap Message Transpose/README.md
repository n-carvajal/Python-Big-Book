## Project 03: Bitmap Message Transpose

This program takes the bitmap image found in:
`03 - Bitmap Message Transpose/bitmap_original.txt`, and replaces the
characters in the image with the characters from a user provided custom message
whilst respecting the white space and line breaks.  
The result is then printed out to:
`03 - Bitmap Message Transpose/bitmap_transposed.txt`.

The user is free to change the contents of
`03 - Bitmap Message Transpose/bitmap_original.txt` to any other image.

Execute `main.py` to run the program.
