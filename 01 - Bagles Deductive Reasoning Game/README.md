## Project 01: Bagels Deductive Reasoning Game

Bagels is a deductive reasoning game where you must guess a random digit
sequence based on clues.
The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess:

* Pico: When your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place.
* Fermi: When your guess has a correct digit in correct place.
* Bagels: When your guess has no correct digits.

Execute `main.py` to run the game.

At start-up the user is prompted to decide how long a digit sequence to guess,
and how many tries are made available for the same.
